# HDX 2.0 Upload

The Longitudinal Systems Analysis (LSA) upload is a .zip file containing a total of 12 CSV files generated by the HMIS application. For the HIC, the same 12 files are submitted, but LSAHousehold and LSAExit may be empty (other than headers) as they do not include any data relevant to the HIC. Files are listed below with a brief description and links to the sections of this document that define the business logic for the file.

A separate data dictionary with a complete list of the columns and values associated with each of these files is available in the [LSA tool kit](https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/5726/lsa-report-specifications-and-tools/) as an Excel workbook.

## Project.csv

The structure of Project is defined by the HMIS CSV; it contains HMIS Data Element _2.02 Project Information_ for continuum ES, SH, TH, RRH, PSH, and/or OPH projects active since LookbackDate. It is referenced as lsa_Project in this document.

See section [4.1Get Project.csv Records / lsa_Project](#_Get_Project.csv_Records).

## Organization.csv

The structure of Organization is defined by the HMIS CSV; it contains HMIS data element _2.01 Organization Information_ for each project included in Project.csv. It is referenced as lsa_Organization in this document.

See section [4.2 Get Organization.csv Records / lsa_Organization](#_Get_Organization.csv_Records).

## Funder.csv

The structure of Funder is defined by the HMIS CSV; it contains HMIS data element _2.06 Funding Sources_ records active during the report period for each project included in Project.csv.

See section [4.3 Get Funder.csv Records / lsa_Funder](#_Get_Funder.csv_Records).

## ProjectCoC.csv

The structure of ProjectCoC is defined by the HMIS CSV; it contains HMIS data element _2.03 Continuum of Care Code_ records associated with ReportCoC for each project included in Project.csv.

See section [4.4 Get ProjectCoC.csv Records / lsa_ProjectCoC](#_Get_Inventory.csv_Records) .

## Inventory.csv

The structure of Inventory is defined by the HMIS CSV; it contains HMIS data element _2.07 Bed and Unit Inventory Information_ records active during the report period for each project included in Project.csv, except for RRH: Services Only projects.

See section [4.5 Get Inventory.csv Records / lsa_Inventory](#_Get_Inventory.csv_Records_1).

## HMISParticipation.csv

The structure of HMISParticipation is defined by the HMIS CSV; it contains affiliation records from HMIS data element _2.08 HMIS Participation_ records active during the report period for each project included in Project.csv.

See section [4.6 Get HMISParticipation.csv Records / lsa_HMISParticipation](#_Get_HMISParticipation.csv_Records).

## Affiliation.csv

The structure of Affiliation is defined by the HMIS CSV; it contains HMIS data element _2.02 Project Information_ (field 2.02B) records for each RRH project in Project.csv with a subtype of RRH-SSO active during the report period and identified as having a residential affiliation.

See section [4.7 Get Affiliation.csv Records / lsa_](#_Get_Affiliation.csv_Records)Affiliation.

## LSAReport.csv

LSAReport contains 67 columns, including report metadata, report parameters, and HMIS data quality reporting. The HDX 2.0 uses these data to process the upload file and to assess the reliability of the data.

See:

- [Section 3.1 Report Parameters and Metadata](#_Report_Parameters_and)
- [Section 9 HMIS Business Logic: LSAReport Data Quality and ReportDate](#_HMIS_Business_Logic:_4)

## LSAPerson.csv

LSAPerson contains 66 columns and includes reporting on people active during the report period. Columns include the following types of data:

- Identifiers for project types, household types, and populations in which clients were served.
- Age categories for all clients; age is the only demographic reported for children who are not heads of household.
- Demographics reported for adults and heads of household, including race/ethnicity, veteran status, disability status, and domestic violence status.

Rows represent specific combinations of these data points. Each active client is counted in one row; the sum of **RowTotal** values in the file is equal to the total number of active clients in the report period.

It is critical that all values in this column are integers > 0. The largest possible number of rows – when each row includes a count of one or more people represented by the distinct combination of column values – is limited to the number of active clients. However, there are billions of possible combinations of column values, and including rows that that do not represent any clients would result in files of unmanageable size.

See [Section 5 HMIS Business Logic: LSAPerson](#_HMIS_Business_Logic:_1).

## LSAHousehold.csv

LSAHousehold contains 67 columns and includes reporting on households active during the report period. Columns include the following types of data:

- Identifiers for project types and populations in which each household was served.
- Demographics plus living situation, destination, household composition, project geography, and system engagement.
- Lengths of time homeless (LOTH) and enrolled in RRH/PSH during the report period and any continuous episode of homelessness prior to ReportStart that overlaps with the report period.

Rows represent specific combinations of these data points. Each active household is counted in one row; the sum of **RowTotal** values in the file is equal to the total number of households active in the report period.

This file may empty (other than headers) for the HIC.

It is critical that all values in the **RowTotal** column are integers > 0. When each row includes a count of one or more households represented by the distinct combination of column values, the total number of rows– is limited to the number of active households. However, the number of possible distinct combinations of column values is massive and including rows that do not represent any households could result in unmanageable file sizes.

See [Section 6: HMIS Business Logic: LSAHousehold](#_HMIS_Business_Logic:_2).

## LSAExit.csv

LSAExit contains 17 columns. The file identifies households with system exits – i.e., exits from a continuum project followed by at least two weeks without an active enrollment – in three distinct periods:

- Cohort -2 – Begins two years prior to the report start date and ends two years prior to the end date.
- Cohort -1– Begins one year prior to the report start date and ends one year prior to the end date.
- Cohort 0 – Begins on the report start date; if the report period is at least six months, the cohort period ends at six months; otherwise, the cohort period is the same as the report period.

Columns include the following types of data:

- Identifiers for project types, household types, and populations in which clients were served;
- Destination types; and
- For clients that returned to a continuum ES, SH, TH, RRH, or PSH project, the length of time to return.

Rows represent specific combinations of these data points. Unlike LSAHousehold, LSAExit may include more than one row for any given household if the household has qualifying exits in more than one cohort period. Each household is counted in one row for each exit cohort in which they occur. The sum of **RowTotal** values in the file, grouped by Cohort, is equal to the total number of households in each of the respective cohorts. It is critical that all values in this column are integers > 0. The largest possible number of rows – when each row includes a count of one or more households represented by the distinct combination of column values – is limited to the number of active households. However, there are billions of possible distinct combinations of column values and including rows that do not represent any households could result in files of unmanageable size.

This file may be empty (other than headers) for the HIC.

See [Section 7. HMIS Business Logic: LSAExit](#_HMIS_Business_Logic:_5).

## LSACalculated.csv

This file is used to upload calculated values for report output that cannot be derived from the aggregate data.

It is used to populate columns that report on average number of days in:

- System Use – Length of Time Homeless
- System Use – Cumulative Length of Time in PSH
- System Use – Length of Time in RRH Projects
- Returns – Days to Return/Re-engage by Exit Destination
- Days to Return/Re-engage by Last Project Type
- Days to Return/Re-engage by System Path
- Days to Return/Re-engage by Population

The averages are related to data in LSAHousehold and LSAExit; they are not relevant for HIC submissions.

It is also used for counts of persons, households, and bed nights grouped by project IDs and project types, including:

- Counts of households and clients active in residence in the report period and on four specific dates during the report period;
- Counts of total bed nights in the report period; and
- HMIS data quality issues that may impact the integrity of LSA reporting.

The **Value** column holds the average or count. Other columns identify the report row, household type, population, etc.
