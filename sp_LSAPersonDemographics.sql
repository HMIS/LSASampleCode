/*
	This will produce the following demographic report tables,
	depending on the @rptTable parameter:
		  Age, Gender, Race, Ethnicity, VetStatus, DVStatus

	It will generate results for these HHTypes / Populations:

popid	popname								HHType
	1	Youth Household 18-21				1
	2	Youth Household 22-24				1
	3	Veteran Household					1
	3	Veteran Household					2
	4	Non-Veteran Household 25+			1
	5	Household with Disabled Adult/HoH	NULL,1,2, or 3
	6	Household with Chronically Homeless NULL,1,2, or 3
	7	Household Fleeing Domestic Violence	NULL,1,2, or 3
	8	Senior Household 55+				1
	9	Parenting Youth Household 18-24		2
	10	Parenting Child Household			3
	11	Household with 3+ Children			2

	5/30/2018 - First version
	9/21/2018 - Update to use table ref_Populations to produce results for 
				a wider variety of populations.
